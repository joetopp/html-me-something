            <p id="Introduction">As most everyone knows, modern human communication is increasingly picture-based. This practice began in the mid-80's with representations of human faces rendered using standard keyboard characters. These creations, known as emoticons, have since been usurped by their unicode cousins, the emoji, which represent facial expressions with actual images rather than with text. The popularity of emoji has been such that many now look on emoticons with the fond condescension of an archeologist surveying crude cave drawings. However, it is my view that emoticons are a monument to free human creativity under constraint, and may yet have more to offer modern conversation. For this reason, this page is dedicated to some of the most memorable and interesting examples of this genre.</p>

                <h2>Nose Smiley <span class="emoticon">:-)</span></h2>
                <p>The nose smiley is one of the earliest emoticons, and shines for its simplicity and unmistakable emotion and readability. However, as time went on and emoticons were commonly understood and recognized, readability was discarded in favor of speed; many users began to drop the hyphen, and the classic <span class="emoticon">:)</span> smiley became the most popular emoticon of all time.</p>
                <p>Despite its decline, Nose Smiley earns its place in this list because of its historical importance and the nuance it can still bring to conversation in the world of the classic smiley. <span class="emoticon">:)</span> has become such a symbol that, in my opinion, it has lost all of its humanity. Nose Smiley, on the other hand, is still as readable as ever, shining at the reader with dopey simplicity that can drive home genuine happiness and blithe wit with equal force.</p>

                <h2>Grumpy Face <span class="emoticon">&gt;:{</span></h2>
                <p>The epitome of unrest, the grumpy face manages to convey a sense of oblique anger and disappointment without breaking into outright rage. It has many competitors for people wishing to express discontent, some of which differ by only one character (ie, <span class="emoticon">&gt;:(</span>, <span class="emoticon">&gt;:[</span>, and <span class="emoticon">&gt;={</span>). These are all good options, but for my money Grumpy Face takes the cake for readibility, expressiveness, and sheer resemblance to this guy:</p>

                <h2>Smug Face <span class="emoticon">:-&gt;</span></h2>
                <p>The smug face was relatively late to the emoticon scene, arriving just as the genre was starting to go out of style. As a result, Smug Face got less attention than it deserved. Many attempts had been made at using the &gt; symbol, most notably <span class="emoticon">:&gt;</span>, which was intended to be a cuter variant of the smiley face. However, this emoticon and many other &gt; smileys were abandoned due to their lack of readibility (they tend to look like birds). The genius of Smug Face is all in the nose, the most commonly forgone component of the emoticon face. As in Nose Smiley, the nose serves to humanize the entire face, finally making the &gt; readable not as a beak but as a gleefuly mischievous smile! No emoticon (or emoji, for that matter) does a better job of gloating after a hard-won argument.</p>

                <h2>Whoa <span class="emoticon">O_o</span></h2>
                <p>The whoa face has the distinction of being one of the few right-side-up faces to make it into common parlance. This alone is a great boon; as used as you get to reading sideways faces, seeing bug-eyes looking out at you from a block of text is far more impactful without intervening mental gymnastics. Another interesting feature of Whoa is that the eyes are totally open, unlike its other beady-eyed cousins that use ; , : , or = for eyes. In fact, these open eyes are the sole expressive vehicle of this face; one gets a distinct impression of being overwhelmed, despite the lack of eyebrows and flat, inexpressive mouth. These unique qualities make Whoa a uniquely powerful emoticon.</p>
