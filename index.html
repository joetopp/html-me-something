            <h1>Notable Emoticons</h1>
            <p>As most everyone knows, modern human communication is increasingly picture-based. This practice began in the mid-80's with representations of human faces rendered using standard keyboard characters. These creations, known as emoticons, have since been usurped by their unicode cousins, the emoji, which represent facial expressions with actual images rather than with text. The popularity of emoji has been such that many now look on emoticons with the fond condescension of an archeologist surveying crude cave drawings. However, it is my view that emoticons are a monument to free human creativity under constraint, and may yet have more to offer modern conversation. For this reason, this page is dedicated to some of the most memorable and interesting examples of this genre.</p>
